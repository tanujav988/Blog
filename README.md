# Blog    
It is a simple blog I've built using HTML and CSS. 
I've always wanted to write blog. So, I learned HTML, CSS to create one. 
Reading books and sharing the experience with others so that they can benefit from it.  
The blog has reviews about 3 books: 
 1.  How to Fight a Hydra: Face Your Fears, Pursue Your Ambitions, and Become the Hero You Are Destined to Be by Josh Kaufman 
 2.  The alchemist by Paulo Coelho
 3.  Steal Like an Artist
