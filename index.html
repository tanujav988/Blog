   <h1>Hi, looking for some books to study/read?</h1>
   <br>
   <p> I could give some reviews about the books I've read which would help you to choose the books.  </p>
   <div class="imag1"><img src="book.jpg" alt="Book Image" class="center"></div>
   <p> Knowledge is everything and the most powerful weapon at everyone's disposal. But most people don't recognize this. And I was one of those people. I took a resolution this year to read at least one book. So I started reading a book and made it a hobby and practice reading at least 30 minutes a day. First two days I didn't give much attention. Later I tried to connect myself with the book which surprisingly had my undivided concentration. I hope I could share my thoughts and some key points of the book which you might find useful to choose the books. I've written the reviews of 3 books which are incredibly amazing. In the beginning, I was afraid I might not finish reading the books. So I started reading the books which had fewer page numbers. By doing this I read 20 books till now. Every time I reread a book I learn something new and it intrigues me. We can learn things through experience. But by reading, we enter a world of new perceptions of other people which gives us tremendous knowledge. 
      So, let's get the reading started!!! </p>

      <h2>Book 1 - How to Fight a Hydra: Face Your Fears, Pursue Your Ambitions, and Become the Hero You Are Destined to <br> Be by Josh Kaufman </h2>
         <pre>              
                Title            -   How to Fight a Hydra
                Author           -   Josh Kaufman
                Genre            -   Adventure, Quest, Self-help, Fantasy
                Number of pages  -   110 </pre> <br>
 <span class="padding">  Some points from the book : </span>  <br>
        <p>   1. I will attempt to write down the lessons I have learned while adventuring so that I can avoid repeating unnecessary mistakes. <br>
          2. I've seen the lack of adventuring destroy more souls than a hydra ever will. <br>
          3. Your mind can invent horrors beyond those that actually exist. Rumination is not your friend. Action allows you to see the situation for what it really is. <br>
          4. Some attacks will hit. Others will miss. You can't predict which in advance. You have to commit to every attack with the same intention: to strike the enemy. <br>
          5. Adventuring requires trust in your own skills, judgement and resilience. That's the primary benefit of experience.  <br>
             Think back to all of the times you've struggled, adapted, and prevailed. You've done it before: you will do it again. <br>
          6. Wisdom consists of anticipating and preventing avoidable mistakes. <br>
          7. Knowing it's going to be difficult makes it easier to keep going. <br>
          8. Everyone wants a guaranteed reward before they put themselves at risk. The world doesn't work that way. <br>
          9. Experiment with different approaches until you find something that works. <br>
        10. Every adventurer feels afraid, and has doubts about their ability. That's normal, not a sign of weakness or cowardice. <br>

          <!-- <p> We live i</p> -->
            <!-- We live in an uncertain,complex, ambiguous and changing world with shifting demands, unexpected(often unwelcome) developments and variable rewards. There's no crystal ball to show you the most direct path to victory, and no method of divination to guarantee you'll avoid making costly mistakes.  -->
          <span class="padding"> My Perspective : </span>
       <p> This is one of the best books I've read. There's no beat around the bush you can find in this book. Everything is to the point. It talks about resilience, perseverance. We have to face our hydra(fear) to achieve our goals. This is not going to be an easy path. We're afraid that we might not be good enough to handle what fortune and happenstance have in for us. It's ok to fear as it is part of our human nature but we shouldn't let this fear get in the way of achieving the goals. This book will help you in guiding how to fight fear using the weapon of your choice. Making mistakes is customary but repeating it, would cost our time. If the journey to your goal is difficult, you must prepare accordingly. One must learn to balance the risks against the potential rewards, commit to the challenge even though the outcome is unknown. <br> You will not regret reading this book. This is a must-read book. </p>

   <span class="padding">  Some points from the book : </span>  <br>
          <p>   1. It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.</br>
             2. Dream was a difficult one. It's the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them.</br>
             3. At a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest lie.</br>
             4. Everthing in life has its price.</br>
             5. I see the world in terms of what I would like see happen, not what actually does.</br>
             6. Every blessing ignored becomes a curse.</br>
             7. Courage is the quality most essential to understanding the Language of the world. </br>
             8. Life is generous to those who pursue their personal lengend(dream/desire).</br>
            </p>
         <span class="padding"> My Perspective : </span>
         <p> We all have dreams. It may be small or big ones. We initially intend to pursue it.  But sometimes due to some circumstances, we feel demotivated, perplexed whether or not to pursue our dream. This book teaches us to follow our passion even at the times of the fear of the unknown. If we don't pursue our dream, it will remain a dream because no one is going to achieve it. There's only YOU can achieve. Because you destined to. We get the prize(dream) only when we the heart prepared for it(to give what it takes to achieve it). If not, we should start preparing for it. <br>
               If you are a beginner, just go for it. It will definitely help you to see your own potential, resolution, tenacity.</p>

          <h2>Book 3 - Steal Like an Artist </h2>
             <pre>              
                    Title            -   Steal Like an Artist
                    Author           -   Austin Kleon
                    Genre            -   Self-help, Creativity, Productivity
                    Number of pages  -   160 </pre> <br>
     <span class="padding">  Some points from the book : </span>  <br>
            <p>   1. What a good artist understands is that nothing comes from nowhere. All creative work builds on what came before. Nothing is completely original. <br>
              2. The artist is a collector. Not a hoarder, mind you, there's a difference: Hoarders collect indiscriminately, artists collect selectively. They only collect things that they really love. <br>
              3. You have to be curious about the world in which you live. Look things up. Chase down every reference. Go deeper than anybody else-that's how you'll get ahead. <br>
              4. Make things, know thyself. <br>
             5. Pretend to be something you're not until you are.
             6. It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique. <br>
             7. Imitation is about copying. Emulation is when imitation goes one step further, breaking through into your own thing. <br>
             8. Work that only comes from the head isn't any good. <br>
             9. If you have two or three real passions, don't feel like you have to choose between them. Don't discard. Keep all your passions in your life. <br>
            10. If you're not into the world you live in, you can build your own world around you. Surround yourself with books and objects that you love. Tape things up on the wall. Create your own world.
              </p>
           <span class="padding"> My Perspective : </span>
           <p> This book starts with a quote : <br>
               "Art is theft"  ---- Pablo Picasso <br>
               It speaks of the surrealistic truth of how an artist sees this world filled with opportunities. It motivates us to look for the possibilities outside of our comfort zone. We don't have to wait for things to happen, we should try different things to know ourselves. Nobody is born with a style or a voice. In the beginning, we learn by pretending and adding something to the world that only you can add. <br>
                 In the end, creativity isn't just the things we choose to put in, it's the things we choose to leave out. <br>
